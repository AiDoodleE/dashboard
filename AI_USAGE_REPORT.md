## AI Tools Used
- **Lovable**: Used to generate a visually appealing **Galaxy-themed UI design**, assisting with layout ideas and color palettes.
- **Dribbble**: Primary inspiration source for dashboard structure, UI animations, and design polish.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Helped generate base component structures, layout scaffolding, and repetitive patterns.
- **Cursor IDE used 60%**: Provided real-time AI support during development for layout iterations and quick fixes.
- **ChatGPT**: Assisted with planning application logic, implementing advanced UI features, debugging layout behavior, and enhancing interactivity.

## Prompts I Use (Examples)
1. “Generate a Galaxy-themed React dashboard layout Design”
2. “Create a customizable layout settings panel with toggles for sidebar, header, and background options.”
3. “Fix inconsistent sidebar toggle behavior on screen resize.”

## AI vs Manual Work Split
- **AI-generated (approx. 40%)**
  - Dashboard layout scaffolding and reusable components.
  - Styling suggestions, including color gradients, shadows, and responsive behavior.
  - Code snippets for light/dark mode switching, transitions, and animation helpers.
- **Manual coding (approx. 60%)**
  - All application **logic and state management** manually written, especially layout customization settings.
  - Logic was built independently with help of ChatGPT — especially for layout customization, settings persistence, and user interaction.
  - With the help of **Cursor IDE and ChatGPT**, these manually built logics were **enhanced, optimized, and structured**.
  - Fonts, hover states, and animations were ideated from internet, implemented through prompts in **ChatGPT/Copilot**, and visually refined using **Cursor IDE**.
